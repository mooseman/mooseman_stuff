 *** Cool apps that are already public domain *** 

1 -  The "sc" spreadsheet - ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/financial/spreadsheet/ 
Ultra-basic, sure, and takes a little while to get used to, but still very cool!  I have a real soft spot for 
old P.D. apps like this.  Interesting that there are a number of public domain text editors, but very few P.D.  
spreadsheets (I only know of one other one, called "sss" - simple spreadsheet.  

2 - SQLite - http://www.sqlite.org/  -  A very good P.D. lightweight SQL database engine.  

3 - The "yeanpypa" Python parser framework - 
http://www.slash-me.net/dev/snippets/yeanpypa/documentation.html
Yeanpypa = YEt ANother PYthon PArser framework. 
Very nice!  Inspired by Boost::Spirit and Pyparsing.  

4 -  Retroforth - http://retroforth.org  
The Forth community seems to be quite a hotbed of P.D.  apps. There are a number of P.D. Forth implementations,
but Retro is one of the most well-known. 

5 - The LZMA data-compression algorithm -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA 
Used in 7-zip (the reference implementation) and a number of other apps.  Released into the 
public domain on Nov 23rd 2008.  The P.D. LZMA software dev kit can be found here - 
http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html 

6 -  A number of text editors, including - 
Editkit - http://freshmeat.net/projects/editkit/

te - http://retroforth.org/projects/darcs/TE/ 

TDE - the Thomson Davis Editor - http://tde.adoxa.cjb.net/ 

The latest one I've found is "edi" - http://home.arcor.de/mdoege/edi/ 

mg - http://pintday.org/hack/mg/ 
The OpenBSD (great O.S.!) readme here has more on mg - 
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/mg/README?rev=1.1&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
Note - As mentioned in the above readme, it is possible that mg may contain some non-P.D. code, but I've included it here for the 
sake of completeness as it is quite well-known.  

7 - p4wn -  http://p4wn.sourceforge.net/  -  P.D.  chess game written in javascript!  

8 - pforth - http://www.softsynth.com/pforth/ - Another P.D. Forth.  

9 - The Cat programming language - http://www.cat-language.com/  -  A functional stack-based language.  Quite similar to Forth.  
 Here's a P.D. Cat interpreter in javascript - http://www.cat-language.com/interpreter.html 

10 - TinyWM - a P.D. window-manager - http://incise.org/tinywm.html

size than lzma!   

20 - 9P - http://users.lava.net/~newsham/plan9/   -  A public domain implementation of Plan 9's 9P network protocol, written in Python (by Tim Newsham).  I haven't actually used this but it looks very cool.
