***  README *** 

Ok, enough procrastination from me.... After trawling around lots of public domain sites
around the net, this is the stuff that I've found.  See the file "cool-apps-that-are-already-
public-domain.txt" for details.  

A pretty mixed bunch of code.  Editors, a spreadsheet (the good old "sc"!), some file-compression 
apps and a few other bits and pieces.
