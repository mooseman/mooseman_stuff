*** A few thoughts on things that it would be great to have public domain versions of *** 

1 - A public domain Git work-alike.  One of the coolest and most elegant apps around!  
This could be started as just a basic single-user version control app. The networking side of 
things could be added later. 

2 -  A public domain "Plan 9" clone.  As I remember seeing somewhere, Plan 9 is sometimes 
called "Unix done right".  A very elegant OS.  

3 - More public domain parsers!  Boost::Spirit is recommended as a *great* framework for building 
parsers. I'll be writing some and putting a few of them in here.   

  In the meantime, have a look at the list of cool things that are *already* public domain!
