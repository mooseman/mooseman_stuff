Cube Editor keys     		       
(Based on Ersatz Emacs (2000/09/14)   )  

M-  means to use the <ESC> key prior to using another key
^A  means to use the control key at the same time as the 'A' key

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			  MOVING THE CURSOR

^F   Forward character   		M-F    Forward word
^B   Backward character  		M-B    Backward word
^N   Next line				M-P    Front of paragraph
^P   Previous line			M-N    End of paragraph
^A   Front of line			M-< or [HOME] Start of file
^E   End of line			M-> or [END] End of file
^V or [Page Down] Scroll down
M-V or [Page Up] Scroll up		Arrow keys are active

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			 DELETING & INSERTING

<-   Delete previous character	        M-<-   Delete previous word
^D   Delete next character		M-D    Delete next word
^K   Delete to end of line		^O     Insert line

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		       FORMATTING & TRANSPOSING

M-U  UPPERCASE word			M-C  Capitalize word
M-L  lowercase word			^T   Transpose characters
^Q   Quote next key, so that control codes may be entered into text.
M-Q  Format paragraph so that text is left-justified between margins.
^X F Set the right margin for paragraph formatting to the current position of
     the cursor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			      SEARCHING

^S   Search forward from cursor position. Type in a string and end it with
     ESC. Either case matches.
^R   As above, but reverse search from cursor position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			      REPLACING

M-R  Replace all instances of first typed-in string with second typed-in
     string. End each string with ESC.
M-%  Replace with query. Answer with:
	Y   replace & continue		N   no replacement & continue
	!   replace the rest		?   Get a list of options
	.   exit and return to entry point
	^G,'q' or <return> exit and remain at current location

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			  COPYING AND MOVING

^@ or M-<spacebar> Set mark at current position.
^W   Delete region.
M-W  Copy region to kill buffer.
^Y   Yank back kill buffer at cursor.

A region is defined as the area between this mark and the current cursor
position. The kill buffer is the text which has been most recently deleted or
copied.

Generally, the procedure for copying or moving text is:
1) Mark out region using M-<spacebar> at the beginning and move the cursor to
   the end.
2) Delete it (with ^W) or copy it (with M-W) into the kill buffer.
3) Move the cursor to the desired location and yank it back (with ^Y).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			   MULTIPLE BUFFERS

A buffer contains a COPY of a document being edited, and must be saved for
changes to be kept. Many buffers may be activated at once.

^X B  Switch to another buffer.
^X ^B Show buffer directory in a window (^X 1 to remove).
^X K  Delete a non-displayed buffer.
^X X  Switch to next buffer in buffer list.
^X N  Change the filename associated with the buffer.
M-N   Change the name of the buffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			  READING FROM DISK

^X^F  Find file; read into a new buffer created from filename.
      (This is the usual way to edit a new file.)
^X^R  Read file into current buffer, erasing its previous contents.
      No new buffer will be created.
^X^I  Insert file into current buffer at cursor's location.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    SAVING TO DISK

^X^S  Save current buffer to disk, using the buffer's filename as the name of
      the disk file. Any disk file of that name will be overwritten.
^X^W  Write current buffer to disk. Type in a new filename at the prompt to
      write to; it will also become the current buffer's filename.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			   MULTIPLE WINDOWS

Many windows may be visible at once on the screen. Windows may show different
parts of the same buffer, or each may display a different one.

^X 2  Split the current window in two	^X 1   Show only current window
^X O  Move cursor to next window	^X ^   Enlarge current window
M-^V  Scroll other window down		M-^Z   Scroll other window up

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			       EXITING

^X^C  Exit. Any unsaved files will require confirmation.
M-Z   Write out all changed buffers automatically and exit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				MACROS

^X (  Start recording a keyboard macro. Typing ^G or an error aborts.
^X )  Stop recording macro.
^X E  Execute macro.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			 REPEAT & NUMBER PREFIX

^U<number> or M-<number>
    Number prefix and universal repeat. May be followed by an integer
    (default = 4) and repeats the next command that many times.
    Exceptions follow.
^U<number>^L
    Reposition the cursor to a particular screen row; i.e., ^U0^L moves the
    cursor and the line it is on to the top of the screen. Negative numbers
    are from the bottom of the screen.
^U<number>M-G
    Go to line <number>. Note this is different behavour to GNU Emacs.
^U<number>^X F
    Set the right margin to column <number> for paragraph formatting.
^U<number>^X^

    window.
