***  The Cube text editor *** 

This is a very small and simple public-domain text editor based on "Ersatz Emacs" 
by Chris Baird  <cjb@brushtail.apana.org.au> .  
The original README by Chris is saved as README-ee.  

As with Chris' version, all source code here is released to the public domain. 

All credit for the code here goes to Chris.  All I have done is - 

a) Commented out several lines which seemed to be causing errors.  After having 
done that, the code compiled fine (although there are still a few warning messages). 

b)  Changed the name to "Cube".  No particular reason for the name, other than that 
it is "short and snappy"..... 

 "Share and enjoy......"     :)
